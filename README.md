# ValmodExpansion-Tweak
My personal tweak of the Valmod Expansion mod

Removes the new zombies that Valmar added along with removing the zombie animals.  Also removes cop's puking/exploding abilities and reducing some of the bullet sponge that the feral zombies do.

Also expanded backpack to 50 slots for testing.
